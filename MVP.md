- New Features:

1) I implemented support for 3d models, fixing the previous bug that only allowed this website to work when using 2d images of shirts. Now the models are implemented and are shown as a carousel of different clothing items. 

2) I added a hover feature that would enlarge the models when a user hovers their mouse over their clothing item.

Fixed Bugs:

1) At first there was still an issue with the 2d image of the shirt popping up on screen with the 3d carousel. I had to get rid of the feature and make sure that the 3d carousel worked as intended.

Next steps:

1) Fix lighting/sizing of clothing to your preference. Also, more clothing items would be nice.

2) Add names/prices to each of the clothing items.
