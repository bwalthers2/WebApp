**Class Dependencies and Prioritization**

To ensure a clear programming roadmap and efficient development, the classes are prioritized based on their dependencies:

1. **SiteManager**
   - **Dependencies**: None initially but interacts with all other classes.
   - **Priority**: High. Acts as the central controller for the application flow and must be developed first.

2. **UserInterface**
   - **Dependencies**: None directly but used across all scenes.
   - **Priority**: High. Essential for user guidance and interactions.

3. **ClothingItem**
   - **Dependencies**: Data source for clothing items.
   - **Priority**: High. Fundamental data model used by multiple classes.

4. **Storefront**
   - **Dependencies**: CameraController, CharacterController, AmbientSoundManager.
   - **Priority**: High. The first user-facing scene that sets the tone for the experience.

5. **CameraController**
   - **Dependencies**: Used by Storefront and other scenes.
   - **Priority**: High. Essential for scene transitions and movement effects.

6. **CharacterController**
   - **Dependencies**: Storefront.
   - **Priority**: Medium. Adds dynamic elements to the storefront but not critical for initial functionality.

7. **AmbientSoundManager**
   - **Dependencies**: Used across all scenes.
   - **Priority**: Medium. Enhances user experience but core functionality can proceed without it.

8. **StoreInterior**
   - **Dependencies**: ClothingCarousel, CategoryManager, UserInterface.
   - **Priority**: High. The main browsing area for clothing items.

9. **ClothingCarousel**
   - **Dependencies**: ClothingItem.
   - **Priority**: High. Central to the interactive browsing experience within the store.

10. **CategoryManager**
    - **Dependencies**: StoreInterior, ClothingCarousel.
    - **Priority**: Medium. Adds filtering functionality but not essential for initial browsing capability.

11. **ChangingRoom**
    - **Dependencies**: ModelViewer, ClothingItem, UserInterface.
    - **Priority**: Medium. Allows detailed viewing but browsing can function without it initially.

12. **ModelViewer**
    - **Dependencies**: ChangingRoom.
    - **Priority**: Medium. Provides interactivity within the changing room.

13. **LoadingManager**
    - **Dependencies**: Used during asset loading across scenes.
    - **Priority**: Medium. Improves user experience during loading times.

**Implementation Notes**

- **Phase 1**: Develop `SiteManager`, `UserInterface`, `ClothingItem`, and `Storefront` along with the `CameraController` to establish the basic application structure and initial scene.
- **Phase 2**: Implement `StoreInterior` and `ClothingCarousel` to enable the core browsing functionality.
- **Phase 3**: Add the `ChangingRoom` and `ModelViewer` for enhanced item inspection.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate `AmbientSoundManager`, `CharacterController`, `CategoryManager`, and `LoadingManager` to enrich the user experience.
- **Testing**: After each phase, thoroughly test the interactions and transitions to ensure smooth functionality.

By focusing on these essential classes and methods, we prioritize critical visual and interactive functionalities. Dependencies are clearly outlined, allowing for a structured and efficient programming sequence. This approach ensures that the most vital components are developed first, providing a solid foundation for the overall user experience.

**Conclusion**

This simplified technical specification provides a clear roadmap for developing an immersive online clothing browsing experience focused on visual creativity. By eliminating purchasing and inventory management components, we streamline the development process to concentrate on the interactive and aesthetic aspects that will engage users effectively.
