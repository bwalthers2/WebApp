# Revised Design for the Online Clothing Shopping System

Currently, most sites are just squares containing an image of the article of clothing, which can then be purchased directly or from your bag (stored items you want to purchase). While it is enjoyable to buy stuff, actually looking through all the clothes and the online shopping process is not at all fun. Modifying this process to be more interactive and visually appealing is my idea for the website. 

The site would be designed like other 3D dimensional sites with different movements and objects instead of just up and down scrolling. The website will start with the user viewing a gloomy store front covered in spray paint to create a sort of mood.

These are two examples of a gloomy store front.

The lights in the stores and on the street should sort of flicker in and out to add to the gloomy, dilapidated effect. This style of store fits best with the streetwear and opium fashion styles. Out front, while the screen shows the storefront, there should be people occasionally walking on the sidewalk and crossing the screen. 

Here are some character images of people with images of their walking stages.

When the user clicks on the door, the camera should slowly move towards the door with some camera shake and wobble to simulate walking, making it feel like the user is actually approaching the store. When close to the front door, it should open, and the camera continues to move into the store. Inside is inspired by a dry cleaner, with a similar vibe to the outside of the store. 

** how will the user know to click on the door? Maybe include a label like "enter clothing store" or something like that. I would also say to make sure the whole home screen experience doesn't take too long to get into the actual clothing store, so make sure the walking animation doesn't take more than like 3 or 4 seconds. 

There is a counter off to the left side of the screen, and the clothing carousel comes in at the top left corner of the visible screen and moves across, still elevated above the ground. After crossing half the screen, it swoops downwards and slightly to the right of the camera before going completely straight. This clothing carousel will have 3D models of every article of clothing sold on the site. 

The carousel will then take a slightly greater than 90° turn to the camera’s right before going back up and into the store. As items on the rack go around the 90-degree turn, they swing outwards so that the entire article of clothing is visible. ChatGPT was really not helpful with this, but here is what it generated after 20 minutes of trying to get my desired interior. This is not it. The actual shop should not be as run-down and weird.

**just reading this, I'm not exactly sure what this is supposed to look like. The wording is sort of confusing but I'm not sure exactly how to fix that. One suggestion is to add a few more images, although I understand that that is easier said than done
**again, labels would probably be pretty useful so users know what to do. A quick label telling users to click on the item would be great.

I also added a drawing of my desired layout, but it isn't as in-depth. Scrolling inside the store should make the clothing conveyor rotate around the rack.

**lol again, make sure users know to scroll to see other clothing items. It could also be helpful to include buttons to see other clothing items to. Ex. left and right arrows users can click on.

When an article of clothing is clicked on, the camera should pan off to a changing room with a curtain covering the entrance. The curtain should move slightly, like there is a breeze, while the site is loading. Once loaded, the curtain should slide over, revealing a full, rotatable 3D model of a person wearing the article of clothing. The user can rotate a full 360° around the model to see the clothes from all angles. Here is some AI-generated content of it.

**this sounds great, I would just say make sure the user knows that it is loading so they don't think it is just some cool animation. Include a quick text saying "loading..." or a spinning wheel of sorts or something like that. Users might also want to see the clothing item without it being on the person, so an option to do that could be useful.

When someone wants to buy the article of clothing, the camera pans from whatever scene you are in to the counter at the front of the store, with a retro cash register sitting on top of it. The article of clothing will be floating above the counter, and the price will appear on the register. Then the user enters their payment, delivery, and all other information into the register, and it updates on the screen in front of the register.

**what would the whole payment interaction look like? where are the buttons, what do they look like, etc

Again, the image below is far too dilapidated, but the AI was really not playing along with me. Once purchased, you revert back to the main scene inside the store to continue shopping.

**last couple ideas. There was no mention of using categories to view specific types of clothing. That should probably be in there. Maybe have an npc you talk to tell them what you want, maybe have different carousel you can choose from, etc. I would also say to make sure you are cautious with the whole gloomy aesthetic because it might be hard to make sure users like looking at your website if it is too dark and stuff. Finally, it could be cool to add some ambient noises and stuff because this feels like the type of website that would have them. Wind when you are on the start screen, a whoosh when the carousel goes by, etc.
